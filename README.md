# OctaveMatlab-MLPrototyping
This repository is for prototyping machine learning algorithms in Octave/ Matlab. These are part of assignments required for completion of Machine Learning by Andrew NG course.
Details of various Machine Learning algorithms implemented and real used cases is as following

	1- Linear Regression
	2- Logistic Regression
	3- Neural Network (Forward Pass) - Implementing One vs All logisitic regression and then using Neural network to recognize hand written digits.
	4- Neural Network (Back Propagation) - Implementing Back propagation technique to hand written digit recognition problem.
	5- Regularised Linear Regression - Additing regularised linear regression to earlier prototyped linear regression model and subsequently study bias and variance properties.
	6- Support Vector Machine - Building an spam calssifier using SVM.
	7- kMeans & PCA - Implementing kMeans to compress image and using Principal Component Analysis to find low dimensional representation of face images.
	8- Anamoly Detection & Collaborative Filtering - Implementing anamoly detection to find the failing servers on a network and using collaborative filtering build a movie recommender system.
